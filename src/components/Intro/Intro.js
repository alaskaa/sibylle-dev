    <WhiteHeadingWrapper>Hi, I'm Sibylle</WhiteHeadingWrapper>
    <p>Frontend Developer based in Berlin.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Curious and always eager to learn about new and better ways to solve a
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>Code, Diagrams and lots of sparkling water are my tools of choice.</p>
    <p>
      I'm excited about development solutions that feel intuitive and provide
      better mental models for our abstractions.
    </p>
    <p>Currently really into React and GraphQL.</p>
    <p>
      When I'm not debugging an error message or crafting the next component,
      I'm sat with a good book & a cup of tea, learning Japanese or finding some
      beautiful spots in the wilderness.
