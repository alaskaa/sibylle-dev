    <WhiteHeadingWrapper>Hi, I'm Sibylle</WhiteHeadingWrapper>
    <p>Software Engineer based in Berlin. Co-Author/Translator of React Deep Dive.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Curious and always eager to learn about new and better ways to solve a
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>Code, Diagrams and lots of sparkling water are my tools of choice.</p>
    <p>
      I'm excited about development solutions that feel intuitive and provide
      better mental models for our abstractions.
    </p>
    <p>Currently really into React and GraphQL. I'm also learning PHP.</p>
    <p>
      When I'm not debugging an error message or crafting the next component,
      I'm either sat with a good book & a cup of tea or finding some
      beautiful spots in the wilderness.
